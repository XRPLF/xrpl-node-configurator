  <p>A Hub server is designed to help connectivity with the network; requires a good network connection. Should set the limit on the peer connection to a bigger number. </p>

            <p class="text-sm">You want to contribute to the overall success of the XRP Ledger, and you happen to have the resources to do that by improving the connectivity within the network. Your hub server has the resources, especially network bandwidth, to connect to many peers at the same time. This server does not do much other than relay messages throughout the network and follow along with consensus, but some number of servers specialized for this role are very helpful to the overall health of the network. Hub servers that are especially reliable may be hard-coded into the rippled source code as connection points where new servers can go to bootstrap their connectivity with the rest of the network. </p>
