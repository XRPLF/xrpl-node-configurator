            <p class="text-sm">You’re experimenting with XRP Ledger software, either developing rippled itself or some kind of integration or app on top of it. You don’t need your server to have production-quality stability, and you are likely to start it up or shut it down frequently. Having some history is nice so that you can look up transactions you sent or received a little while ago, but you don’t need to keep a large amount of history and it’s not that bad if you wipe it and start from scratch. You might hop around between different network chains (e.g. Devnet, Testnet, etc.) or run experimental code. You need an admin API and you might experiment with any other features of the code but you likely don’t have a cluster. It’s likely you may want to run with a higher level of logging than any other use case.</p>
