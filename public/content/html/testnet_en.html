<h4>TestNet</h4>
<div class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600">
  <p>An "alternate universe" network that acts as a testing ground for software built on the XRP Ledger, without impacting production XRP Ledger users and without risking real money. The amendment status of the Testnet is intended to closely mirror the Mainnet, although slight variations in timing may occur due to the unpredictable nature of decentralized systems.</p>
  <p>Testnet and Devnet each have their own separate supply of test XRP, which Ripple gives away for free to parties interested in experimenting with the XRP Ledger and developing applications and integrations. Test XRP does not have real-world value and is lost when the network is reset.</p>
