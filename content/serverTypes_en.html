<h4>XRP Ledger Server Modes</h4>
<div class="text-gray-600 text-sm mt-2">
    <p>The XRP Ledger server software can run in several modes depending on its configuration, including:
    </p>
    <ul class="pl-2 mt-2">
        <li><strong>All-purpose server</strong></li>
        <li class="mt-2"><strong>Validating server, or validator for short</strong></li>
        <li class="mt-2"><strong>Hub server</strong></li>
        <li class="mt-2"><strong>Full History server</strong></li>
        <li class="mt-2"><strong>Development server</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-2">
    You can also run the XRP Ledger executable as a client application for accessing XRP Ledger APIs locally. (Two instances of the same binary can run side-by-side in this case; one as a server, and the other running briefly as a client and then terminating.)
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
    For information on the commands to run XRP Ledger in each of these modes, see the Commandline Reference.</p>
