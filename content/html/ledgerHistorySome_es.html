<h4>Some History</h4>
<div class="text-gray-600 text-sm mt-2">
  <p>The server can backfill history from before it became synced, as well as filling in any gaps in the history it has collected after syncing. (Gaps in ledger history can occur if a server temporarily becomes too busy to keep up with the network, loses its network connection, or suffers other temporary issues.) To backfill history, the server requests data from its peer <code>rippled</code> servers. The amount the server tries to backfill is defined by the <code>[ledger_history]</code> setting.</p>
  <p class="mt-2">If <a href="https://xrpl.org/online-deletion.html" class="text-blue-500" target="_blank">online deletion <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> and advisory deletion are both enabled, the server automatically backfills data up to the oldest ledger it has not been allowed to delete yet. This can fetch data beyond the number of ledger versions configured in the <code>[ledger_history]</code> and <code>online_delete</code> settings. The <a href="https://xrpl.org/can_delete.html" class="text-blue-500" target="_blank">can_delete method <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> tells the server what ledger versions it is allowed to delete.</p>
