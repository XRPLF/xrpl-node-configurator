<h4>DevNet</h4>
<div class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600">
  <p>A preview of coming attractions, where unstable changes to the core XRP Ledger software may be tested out. Developers can use this altnet to interact with and learn about planned new XRP Ledger features and amendments that are not yet enabled on the Mainnet.</p>
  <p>Testnet and Devnet each have their own separate supply of test XRP, which Ripple gives away for free to parties interested in experimenting with the XRP Ledger and developing applications and integrations. Test XRP does not have real-world value and is lost when the network is reset.</p>
