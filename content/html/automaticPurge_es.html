<h4>Automatic Purge</h4>
<div class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600">
  <p>
    The online deletion feature lets the rippled server delete the server's local copy of old ledger versions to keep disk usage from rapidly growing over time. The default config file sets online deletion to run automatically, but online deletion can also be configured to run only when prompted. New in: rippled 0.27.0 
  </p>
  <p>
    The server always keeps the complete current state of the ledger, with all the balances and settings it contains. The deleted data includes older transactions and versions of the ledger state that are older than the stored history.

          <p class="font-bold">Tip</p>
          <p class="text-sm">Even with online deletion, the amount of disk space required to store the same time span's worth of ledger data increases over time, because the size of individual ledger versions tends to grow over time. This growth is very slow in comparison to the accumulation of data that occurs without deleting old ledgers. For more information on disk space needs, see Capacity Planning.</p>
