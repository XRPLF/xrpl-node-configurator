<h4>Websockets Public</h4>
<div class="text-gray-900 text-sm">WebSocket follows a model where the client and server establish one connection, then send messages both ways through the same connection, which remains open until explicitly closed (or until the connection fails). This is in contrast to the HTTP-based API model (including JSON-RPC and RESTful APIs), where the client opens and closes a new connection for each request.ยน</div>
