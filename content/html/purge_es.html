<h4>Purgado de datos automatico</h4>
<div class="text-gray-600 text-sm mt-2">
  <p>In its default configuration, the rippled server automatically deletes outdated history of XRP Ledger state and transactions as new ledger versions become available. 
    This is sufficient for most servers, which do not need older history to know the current state and process transactions. However, it can be useful for the network if some servers provide as much history of the XRP Ledger as possible.</p>

      <p class="font-bold">Tip</p>
      <p class="text-sm">Even with online deletion, the amount of disk space required to store the same time span's worth of ledger data increases over time, because the size of individual ledger versions tends to grow over time. This growth is very slow in comparison to the accumulation of data that occurs without deleting old ledgers. For more information on disk space needs, see

<h4 class="mt-4">Advisory Deletion</h4>

    <p class="mt-2">
        You can use advisory deletion with a scheduled job to trigger automatic deletion based on clock time instead of the number of ledger versions closed.
