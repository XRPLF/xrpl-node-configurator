            <p class="text-sm">You use the XRP Ledger APIs extensively for your work, so you have one or even multiple machines that are dedicated to this purpose. Maybe you’re tracking analytics, maybe you send transactions at high volume, maybe you’re providing a public server as a means of increasing your social capital. If you’re a medium-sized business, you might run one of these as a hot backup to your all-purpose server so that critical business functions can continue through a hardware failure or a partial outage. This machine stores a moderate to high amount of history, but has little to no unique persistent settings, so that additional exact clones can be spun up and down on short notice or even automatically; it does not run as a validator because each validator must be unique and these servers are meant to be numerous and interchangeable. It may or may not serve a public API to the open internet. If you run several servers, they may be clustered with one another. </p>
