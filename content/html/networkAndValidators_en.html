  <p>There is one production XRP Ledger peer-to-peer network, and all business that takes place on the XRP Ledger occurs within the production networkâ€”the Mainnet.
<br>To help members of the XRP Ledger community interact with XRP Ledger technology without affecting anything on the Mainnet, Ripple hosts two alternative networks, or altnets: the Testnet and the Devnet.</p>
