<h4>Database Types</h4>
<div class="text-gray-600 text-sm mt-2">
  <p><strong>rippled</strong> creates <strong></strong>4 SQLite databases</strong> to hold bookkeeping information
    about transactions, local credentials, and various other things.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-2">It also creates the <strong>NodeDB</strong>, which holds all the objects that
    make up the current and historical ledgers.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-2">
    The size of the NodeDB grows in proportion to the amount of new data and the
    amount of historical data (a configurable setting) so the performance of the
    underlying storage media where the NodeDB is placed can significantly affect
    the performance of the server.</p>
