            <p class="text-sm">You want to help keep the XRP Ledger network online and humming along smoothly. You might have different machines you use for other purposes, or you might actually send or receive XRPL transactions sparingly enough that you don’t run a machine for that purpose. Maybe you don’t even use the XRPL very much directly, but you’re associated with another entity that does. (For example, a charity org might run a validator while governments and companies it assists actually use the XRPL for transaction stuff.) Most likely, you run this as a private peer, and it might be clustered with several other servers you also operate such as a hub server and API servers.</p>
