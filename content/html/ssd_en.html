  <p>NuDB is an append-only key-value store that is optimized for SSD drives.
  </p><p class="mt-2">
    NuDB has nearly constant performance and memory footprints regardless of the amount of data being stored. NuDB requires a solid-state drive, but uses much less RAM than RocksDB to access a large database.
  </p><p class="mt-2"></p> 
    Non-validator production servers should be configured to use NuDB and to store the amount of historical data required for the use case.
