<h4>Full History</h4>
<div class="text-gray-600 text-sm mt-2">
  <p>Some servers in the XRP Ledger network are configured as "full-history" servers. These servers, which require significantly more disk space than other tracking servers, collect all available XRP Ledger history and <strong>do not use online deletion</strong>.</p><div class="mt-2 bg-blue-100 border-t-4 border-blue-500 rounded-b text-blue-900 px-4 py-3 shadow-md" role="alert">

      <p class="font-bold">Warning</p>
      <p class="text-sm">Storing full history is expensive. As of 2018-12-11, the full history of the XRP Ledger occupies approximately <strong>9 terabytes</strong> of disk space, which must be entirely stored on fast solid state disk drives for proper server performance. Such a large amount of solid state storage is not cheap, and the total amount of history you must store increases by approximately 12 GB per day.</p>
