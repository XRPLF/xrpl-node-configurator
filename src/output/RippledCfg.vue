# This is primary persistent datastore for rippled.  This includes transaction
# metadata, account states, and ledger headers.  Helpful information can be
# found at https://xrpl.org/capacity-planning.html#node-db-type
# type=NuDB is recommended for non-validators with fast SSDs. Validators or
#    slow / spinning disks should use RocksDB. Caution: Spinning disks are
#    not recommended. They do not perform well enough to consistently remain
#    synced to the network.
# online_delete=512 is recommended to delete old ledgers while maintaining at
#    least 512.
# advisory_delete=0 allows the online delete process to run automatically
#    when the node has approximately two times the "online_delete" value of
#    ledgers. No external administrative command is required to initiate
#    deletion.
